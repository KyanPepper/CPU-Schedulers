CPU Scheduler
A simple CPU scheduler simulation in C that demonstrates different scheduling algorithms for process management. This project includes implementations of popular CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin.

Features
Simulates process scheduling with various algorithms.
Supports First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR).
Tracks process execution times, waiting times, and turnaround times.
